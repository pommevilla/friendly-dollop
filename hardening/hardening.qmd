# Overview

RStudio uses secure defaults wherever possible, but for maximal security hardening it's necessary to use values that make stronger assumptions or require additional configuration. This section of the Administration Guide demonstrates the use of these more secure configuration values and describes other security considerations. 

A summary of these recommendations in the form of a set of example configuration files is presented at the end of this section: [Example Secure Configuration](example_secure_configuration.qmd)
