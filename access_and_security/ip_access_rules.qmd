## IP Access Rules {.pro-header}

RStudio Workbench can be configured to deny access to specific IP addresses or ranges of addresses.  Access rules are defined in the configuration file `/etc/rstudio/ip-rules` 

Access rules are established using the `allow` and `deny` directives and are processed in order, with the first matching rule governing whether a given address is allowed or denied. For example, to allow only clients within the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet but also deny access to `192.168.1.10` you would use these rules:

```ini
# /etc/rstudio/ip-rules
deny    192.168.1.10
allow   192.168.1.0/24
deny    all
```

All clients outside of the specified subset are denied access because of the `deny all` rule at the end of the configuration.

Note that changes to the configuration will not take effect until the server is restarted.
