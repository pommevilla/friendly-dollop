## Cookies

By default, when RStudio Workbench is configured with SSL, all authorization cookies are marked with the `secure` cookie attribute. If you wish to use your own SSL termination but force RStudio to mark cookies as `secure`, you can add the following configuration option:

```ini
# /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
auth-cookies-force-secure=1
```
