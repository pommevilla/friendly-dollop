## Network Port and Address

After initial installation RStudio accepts connections on port 8787. If you wish to listen on a different another port you can modify the `www-port` option. For example:

```ini
# /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
www-port=80
```

By default RStudio binds to address 0.0.0.0 (accepting connections from any remote IP). You can modify this behavior using the `www-address` option. For example:

```ini
# /etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
www-address=127.0.0.1
```

Note that changes to the configuration will not take effect until the server is restarted.
