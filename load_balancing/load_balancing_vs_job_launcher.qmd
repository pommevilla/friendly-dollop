## Load Balancing vs. Job Launcher

The [Job Launcher](../job_launcher/job_launcher.qmd) is another method supported by RStudio Workbench to achieve **increased capacity** by allowing sessions to run using a compatible computing infrastructure (i.e. Kubernetes). However, the Job Launcher does not aim to provide **higher availability**. At least two RStudio Workbench nodes in a load balancing configuration are still required to provide service continuity in failover scenarios.

The Job Launcher itself can have its own load balancing strategy in place. See the loading balancing section in the [Job Launcher](../job_launcher/job_launcher.qmd) documentation for more details.
