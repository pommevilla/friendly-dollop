# Overview

## R Versions {.pro-header}

RStudio Workbench enables users and administrators to have very fine-grained control over which versions of R are used in various contexts. Capabilities include:

-  Administrators can install several versions of R and specify a global default version as well as per-user or per-group default versions.

-  Users can switch between any of the available versions of R as they like.

- Users can specify that individual R projects remember their last version of R and always use that version until explicitly migrated to a new version.

Flexible control over R versions makes it much easier to provide upgraded versions of R for users (or individual projects) that require them; while at the same time not disrupting work that requires continued use of older versions.
