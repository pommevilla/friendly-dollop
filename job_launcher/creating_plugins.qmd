## Creating plugins

Plugins allow communication with specific batch cluster / container orchestration systems like Slurm and Kubernetes. However, you may be using a system that RStudio does not natively support. The [RStudio Launcher Plugin SDK](https://rstudio.com/products/launcher-plugin-sdk) can be used to quickly develop Plugins in C/C++.
