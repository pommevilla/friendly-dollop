## Running the Launcher

Once it is configured, you can run the Job Launcher by invoking the command `sudo rstudio-launcher start`, and stop it with `sudo rstudio-launcher stop`. The Job Launcher must be run with root privileges, but similar to `rstudio-server`, privileges are immediately lowered. Root privileges are used only to impersonate users as necessary.
