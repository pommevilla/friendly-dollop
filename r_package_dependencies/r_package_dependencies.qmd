# R Package Dependencies

The following is a list of all of the R packages RStudio depends on in some way. None of these packages are necessary for the basic operation of RStudio; they all enable additional IDE functionality as noted in in *Features*.

This information is also available in the IDE itself using the **rstudioapi** package as follows:

    rstudioapi::getRStudioPackageDependencies()

Note that some of these packages may require a higher version of R than RStudio itself requires; consult the individual package's documentation for more details.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
json <- jsonlite::read_json("../../../src/cpp/session/resources/dependencies/r-packages.json")

# extract a list of all the short names of the features
features <- names(json$features)

# begin building a table of information for each R package
packages <- lapply(names(json$packages), function(name) {
  
  # find a list of all features which use this package
  included <- vapply(features, function(feature) {
     name %in% json$features[[feature]]$packages
  }, TRUE)
  
  # find the pretty names of those features
  featureNames <- vapply(json$features[included], function(feature) {
    feature$description
  }, "")
  
  # combine name, version, and features into a list
  list(Name = name, 
       Version = json$packages[[name]]$version,
       Features = paste(featureNames, collapse = ", "))  
})

# format as a data table and print
deps <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, packages)
deps <- deps[order(deps$Name),]
row.names(deps) <- NULL
knitr::kable(deps)
```
