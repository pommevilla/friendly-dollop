## Product Activation

### Activation Basics

When RStudio Workbench is first installed on a system it operates in evaluation mode for a period of time and then subsequently requires activation for continued use.

To determine the current license status of your system you can use the following command:

```bash
$ sudo rstudio-server license-manager status
```

After purchasing a license to RStudio Workbench you'll receive a license key that can be used to activate the license on a given system.

You can activate your license key with the command:

```bash
$ sudo rstudio-server license-manager activate <product-key>
```

If you want to move your license of RStudio Workbench to another system you should first deactivate it on the old system with the command:

```bash
$ sudo rstudio-server license-manager deactivate
```
