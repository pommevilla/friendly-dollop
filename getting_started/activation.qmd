## Activation {.pro-header}

After completing the installation steps described in the previous section you may need to activate the product before using it. Alternatively, if you haven't previously installed RStudio Workbench on a system then it will run in evaluation mode for a period of time before requiring activation. To determine the current license status of your system you can use the following command:

```bash
$ sudo rstudio-server license-manager status
```

To activate the product you obtain a product key and then use the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo rstudio-server license-manager activate <product-key>
$ sudo rstudio-server restart
```

Note that you need to restart the server in order for licensing changes to take effect.

Additional details on license management (including discussions of offline activation and activating through a proxy server) can be found in the [License Management](../license_management/license_management.qmd) section.
